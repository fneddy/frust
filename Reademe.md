# FRust[^German] a forth written in rust

[^German]: Pun(s) intended

> The only way to learn Forth is to write a Forth yourself [^LeoBrodie]

So, here I am, writing my first forth and having no idea about what I am doing. 

The rules are simple:

- no tricks
- no optimization
- no shortcuts
- only forth CORE (others parts only if needed)
- KISS
- DRY
- TDD
- doctest!

I will try my best to write idiomatic rust. However because my rust skills are ... *rusty* ...
it may look very rough. 

I will document and explain everything. If not for you then at least so I can come back in 5 
years and still understand what I have done here.
